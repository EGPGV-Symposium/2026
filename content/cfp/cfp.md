The Eurographics Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization (EGPGV) aims to foster the exchange of experiences and knowledge on leveraging and defining new trends in parallel graphics and visualization. This area is important due to the widespread availability of multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cluster systems. Computationally demanding and data-intensive applications in graphics and visualization are strongly affected by this trend and require novel, efficient parallel solutions.

EGPGV 2026 will take place on June 8, 2026, and will be co-located with EuroVis 2026, held June 8 to June 12, 2026, in Nottingham, United Kingdom.

The proceedings of EGPGV will be published in the Eurographics Proceedings Series and the Eurographics Digital Library.

EGPGV seeks papers on graphics and visualization that involve parallel computing and/or focus on very large data sets. Papers on techniques, data structures, algorithms, systems, and applications are welcomed. Parallel computing includes high-performance computing and cloud environments, (multi-)GPU computing and heterogeneous, hybrid architectures, and shared and/or distributed memory architectures. Further, papers focused on processing very large data sets (either for visualization or graphics) are welcomed, even if they do not have a particular focus on parallelism.

Typical symposium topics include:

- Computationally and data-intensive rendering
- Scientific visualization (e.g., volume, flow, and tensor visualization)
- Machine learning as applied to parallel graphics, visualization, and/or large data analytics
- Information visualization and visual analytics
- In situ analytics and in situ visualization
- Out-of-core processing of large data sets for visualization or graphics
- Simulations for virtual environments (physics-based animation, collision detection, acoustics)
- Mesh processing, level-of-detail, and geometric methods
- Visual computing (image- and video-based rendering, image processing and exploitation, segmentation)
- Scheduling, memory management, and data coherence
- Parallelization approaches and algorithms, such as MapReduce
- Database-related methods, algorithms or approaches, and query-based visualization
- Advanced hardware for data handling or visualization
- Large and high-resolution displays, virtual environments
- Scientific, engineering, and industrial applications
- Data analytics on large scientific data sets
- Neural rendering on GPU clusters and heterogeneous architectures
- Machine learning-based compression for low-latency remote rendering
- Machine learning for AR/VR rendering performance optimization
- Machine learning-guided scheduling, load balancing, or resource prediction in graphics applications
- Energy-efficient graphics pipelines using Machine learning

In general, appropriate topics for the symposium fall into one of four categories:

(1) parallel graphics,  
(2) rendering of very large data sets,  
(3) parallel visualization and analytics, and  
(4) processing of large data sets for visualization or analytics.
